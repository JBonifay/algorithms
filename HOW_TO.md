# How to use

The project contains 2 branches "master" and "solution"

Master branch give you with commentary that you have to replace with code
Solution branch show the solution in case you did not arrive with commentaries from Master branch

In order to test your code, each algorithm has its own test classes.    
Step to follow should be:   
- Replace commentaries with code
- run test 
- fix code if tests don't pass
